  <p>Konstru is a structure modeling streamlining web application originally developed by Thornton Tomasetti, a large, multinational engineering company. In the world of structural engineering, there are many independent applications developed for a single, specific purpose. For each of these, a unique model must be created by the engineer tailored to the softwareâ€™s needs. Konstru does this work for the engineer, allowing them to spend more of their time actually designing buildings. Over the summers of 2017 and 2018, I worked to develop this web application with other members of the Thornton Tomasetti team.</p>
  <p>In summary, I contributed to developing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A responsive and reactive front-end</li>
    <li>Visualizations of the model and of the building</li>
    <li>Creating an API for the app to query</li>
    <li>Maintaining the cloud services of the application</li>
    <li>Creating a portable, web-independent solution of the software</li>
  </ul>
