  <p>DeGaetano & Carr LLP is a New York based law firm. Their attorneys focus on residential real estate transactions, commercial and residential leases, business law, not-for-profit law, trust and estate planning, trust administration, and estate administration.</p>
  <p>Over the summer of 2018, I worked to develop the website for the company, allowing them to solely focus on what they do best: representing their clients.</p>
  <p>In summary, what I developed was:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A responsive front-end</li>
    <li>A method to migrate their previous systems to this upgraded one</li>
    <li>Interactive methods to reach the firm</li>
  </ul>
