  <p>Bullseye Property Redevelopment is a professional, full service real estate solutions firm that buys and sells properties throughout Eastern Michigan.</p>
  <p>Over the summer of 2018, I worked to develop the web systems for the company, allowing them to solely focus on buying and selling homes. I continue to maintain the website to this day, accommodating requests from the company.</p>
  <p>In summary, what I developed was:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A responsive and dynamic front-end</li>
    <li>Tools for the company to easily add new houses to display</li>
    <li>Means for the company to alter house data and feature select ones</li>
    <li>Methods for the company to transition homes between statuses</li>
    <li>Solutions for prospective home-owners, contractors, and agents to work with the company</li>
    <li>Back-end analytics for the company to understand which homes are interesting for prospective buyers</li>
  </ul>
