  <p>Team Lyders is the brand of the largest privately owned franchisee of Yum Brands. They currently own approximately 200 Taco Bell and Arbyâ€™s restaurants throughout the Midwest and Canada.</p>
  <p>Since the summer of 2019, I have worked to redevelop the web systems for the company. With the ease of use of the new system, the stores can focus on selling food and pleasing customers, and the corporate office can focus on expansion and profit.</p>
  <p>In summary, what I have contributed to developing is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A responsive front-end</li>
    <li>A streamlined user experience</li>
    <li>Maintaining tens of millions of rows of data</li>
    <li>Systems that stores use to create tickets for maintenance issues</li>
    <li>Automated alerting for maintenance employees to address tickets</li>
    <li>Generated reports about the stores, employees, and applicants for the corporate office to utilize</li>
    <li>Forms and approval systems for HR and Payroll to complete about individual employees, including promotions, vacation/sick leave, wage changes, store transfers, mileage reimbursements, terminations, payroll deductions, and direct deposits</li>
    <li>Methods to analyze store security to minimize losses</li>
    <li>Solutions to ease the process of paying employees and completing taxes</li>
    <li>Means of evaluating employees and rewarding them when applicable</li>
    <li>Access of essential company resources</li>
  </ul>
