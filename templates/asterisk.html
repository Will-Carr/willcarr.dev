  <p>Asterisk is a structure modeling web application developed by Thornton Tomasetti, a large, multinational engineering company. Usually, verifying the structural integrity of buildings takes hours to manually calculate, prohibiting the engineer from iterating and improving their design quickly. Asterisk utilizes machine learning models to predict these calculations in the early phases of design, allowing engineers to improve their designs in a timely manner. Over the summers of 2017 and 2018, I worked to develop this web application with other members of the Thornton Tomasetti team.</p>
  <p>In summary, I contributed to developing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A responsive and reactive front-end</li>
    <li>Visualizations of the model and of the building</li>
    <li>Collecting building data and constructing the machine learning models</li>
    <li>Creating an API for the app to query</li>
    <li>Maintaining the cloud services of the application</li>
  </ul>
